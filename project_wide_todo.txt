1) Improve the error messages for I/O related functions to be more clear
2) Revise/improve the project README
3) Maybe change check for valid parameters comments to be check for valid arguments
4) make sure all import statements are relative to root
5) I passed the tests for 'Calling Functions' assignment, but I have no idea how to successfully prompt the AI to run a
    python file and use arguments. I'm unsure if it's working correctly and I'm prompting wrong, or if it is not working
    correctly and needs to be fixed.
