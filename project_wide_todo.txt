1) Improve the error messages for I/O related functions to be more clear
2) Revise/improve the project README
3) Maybe change check for valid parameters comments to be check for valid arguments
4) make sure all import statements are relative to root
5) I passed the tests for 'Calling Functions' assignment, but I have no idea how to successfully prompt the AI to run a
    python file and use arguments. I'm unsure if it's working correctly and I'm prompting wrong, or if it is not working
    correctly and needs to be fixed.
6) Add a funcitonality to tell the user the total number of tokens that are used with each prompt
7) explore the need for more helper functions
8) document get_agent_response.py
9) add 20 call max to config.py
10) it seems to hallucinate when going down a long string of files and not keep checking the contents?
